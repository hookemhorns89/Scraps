## VARIABLES
## Here we ask the user about various options.
## You may comment out the ones you don't use.
## You may also hard-code any favorite settings.

## FILENAME
## Filename does not need extension
## Screencast will prompt on overwrite
echo "Please enter filename:"
	read filename

## RESOLUTION
## Resolution needs to be in 'WIDTHxHEIGHT' format
## Example: 1280x800 or 800x600 or 1920x1200
echo "Please enter resolution, ex: 1280x800"
	read resolution

## FRAMERATE 
## Adjust how many frames per second you'd like.
## Common framerates are 24, 25, and 30. Less or more is ok.
## To decrease filesize, try lowering this value
echo "Frames Per Second, ex: 1-60"
	read fps

## COMPRESSION
## If you want high quality, and high filesize, choose 1.
## If you want good quality, and less filesize, choose 5.
echo "Compression, ex: 1-5, 1=great 5=nope"
	read quality

## EVERYTHING ELSE
## I use ffmpeg. If you are more of a LibAV person, 
## then consider yourself part of the problem and reason
## that I had to learn to write this program.
## To add variables, substitute any value for $value and
## remember to add some type of input and read up top.
ffmpeg -f alsa -ac 2 -i hw:0,0 -f x11grab -s $resolution -r $fps -i :0.0 -qscale $quality $filename.mp4

## The alsa -ac 2 part is the audio, the 2 is the number of channels.
## The -i hw:0,0 is your hardware address for your microphone
## The -f x11grab defines your screensize for $resolution value
## The -r is FrameRATE for $fps value
## The -i :0.0 is your first monitor, [I think]
## Qscale defines the quality/compression
## All formats come out as MP4, but you can make it a variable for
## choosing your favorite format.
